      <h1>Minitel: France's Digital Pioneer</h1>

      <h2>What was Minitel?</h2>
      <p>
        The Minitel, officially known as TELETEL, was an interactive videotex
        online service accessible through telephone lines. It was the world's
        first and most successful mass-market online service prior to the World
        Wide Web. It was developed in Cesson-Sévigné, Brittany by
        government-owned France Télécom.

      <h2>How Minitel Worked...</h2>
      <p>
        Minitel connected users via telephone lines using a terminal that
        resembled a small computer. The service used videotex technology,
        transmitting data at low speeds but was revolutionary at the time for
        providing instant access to a variety of services. Users navigated the
        system by entering numeric codes displayed on the screen, similar to
        early forms of hyperlinks.
      </p>

      <h2>Minitel vs. The Internet</h2>
      <p>
        While Minitel predated the internet, there were some significant
        differences between the two:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Access:</strong> Minitel was primarily accessed via dedicated
          terminals connected through telephone lines, whereas the internet
          relies on personal computers or smartphones with broadband
          connections.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Technology:</strong> Minitel used videotex technology, a
          system transmitting data at slow speeds over telephone lines. The
          internet, however, uses TCP/IP protocols and provides much faster,
          richer multimedia content.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Content:</strong> Minitel offered curated services controlled
          by France Télécom, while the internet is open, allowing for more
          diversity and innovation in content.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Cultural Impact of Minitel</h2>
      <p>
        Minitel didn’t just change the way people accessed services; it
        influenced French culture. Millions of users interacted with each other
        in ways that were previously impossible, with chat rooms and early
        online forums creating a new digital social space. Businesses adapted to
        the platform, and the French became accustomed to online shopping and
        service browsing long before these practices became commonplace
        elsewhere in the world.

      <h2>Legacy</h2>
      <p>
        The impact of Minitel on France's internet development remains
        controversial. While it offered many services now available online and
        was used for political activism, the government's focus on Minitel
        hindered internet adoption. Despite peak usage in the 1990s, Minitel
        terminals persisted until 2012. France Télécom's resources were diverted
        to Minitel, delaying internet initiatives. However, France's internet
        penetration eventually caught up with other Western countries.
